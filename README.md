# Introduction to Arkouda

This repository contains a hands-on tutorial demonstrating how to use Arkouda for scalable exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the 2018 NYC Squirrel Census dataset. Learn how to connect to an Arkouda server, manipulate distributed arrays and dataframes, perform groupbys, and visualize results — all at scale.

### Features:

- Launch and connect to an Arkouda server
- Create and manipulate distributed arrays (`pdarray`)
- Work with Arkouda DataFrames and convert to/from pandas
- Perform `groupby` aggregations efficiently
- Use Arkouda for “needle in a haystack” queries
- Visualize data with `matplotlib` after transferring to NumPy arrays
